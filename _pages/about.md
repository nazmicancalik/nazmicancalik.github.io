I'm Nazmican, a Machine Learning Engineer who believes the best ideas come during bike rides and coffee breaks.

By day, I work on AI systems that generate realistic videos and understand 3D objects. By weekend, I'm either conquering Bavarian hiking trails, exploring Munich on two wheels, or conducting very serious research on the optimal espresso-to-milk ratio.

Got a cool ML project? Know a great hiking trail? Found an amazing coffee shop? Let's chat!
